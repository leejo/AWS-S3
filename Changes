0.03_01 2012-06-14
  Work done by Evan Carroll (http://www.evancarroll.com)
  - Migrated to Moose & removed dependencies on VSO
  - Fixed bug introduced by previous commit, reverted to contenttype & all tests pass

0.028 2012-03-01
  - Fixed: AWS/S3.pm required a higher version of VSO than the Makefile.PL and META.yml.
  - Strange: Local testing shows $bucket->delete_multi works, but it gives me
    some problems in production.

0.027 2012-02-24
  - Fixed sporadic error:
    "Invalid value for AWS::S3::File.size: isn't a Int: [Str] 'contenttype': Must contain only numbers 0-9"

0.026 2012-01-30
  - $bucket->file( $missing_file ) was failing silently, causing strange behavior
    further upstream.  Now it will confess with the http response from S3.

0.025 2012-01-12
  - $bucket->delete_multi( @keys ) actually works now.

0.024 2012-01-05
  - Better integration with CloudFront.
  - More CF-related updates are on the way.

0.023 2012-01-04
  - Complete overhaul of the request-signing methodology.  Amazon should not be
    allowed to design any more public APIs until they learn about this little
    thing we call "Uniformity"

0.022 2012-01-04
  - was never actually released...we skipped from 0.021 to 0.023

  - Updated to be compatible with VSO 0.21

0.019 2011-12-14
  - Bucket's S3 was a weak ref, which caused problems sometimes.  Not anymore...
    we'll see if that fixes it.

0.018 2011-12-13
  - Thanks to ukautz++ (Ulrich Kautz) for adding the ability to set the content-type
    of files stored in S3.
  - He even updated the POD to show how to set the content-type (via 'contenttype').

0.017 2011-12-11
